# Description
Homework 1

# User story
Modified the HTML file to make it more human readable.
Ordered classes and Idâ€™s to avoid redundancies and make them easy to identify on the CSS file.
Regroup classes with the same property to have less selectors on the CSS file.
Fixed the header links to redirect you to the correct part of the site.
I left the code as clean as I could.
